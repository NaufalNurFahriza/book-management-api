A RESTful API service for managing books and their categories. This project is built using Go with Gin framework and PostgreSQL database.

## Features

- JWT Authentication
- Book Management (CRUD operations)
- Category Management (CRUD operations)
- Automatic book thickness calculation
- Input validation
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Audit trails (created_at, created_by, modified_at, modified_by)

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- PostgreSQL 12 or higher
- Git

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-management-api.git
cd book-management-api
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
go mod tidy
```

3. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```
DB_HOST=your-db-host
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your-db-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
DB_NAME=your-db-name
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
```

4. Run database migrations
```bash
go run migrations/migrate.go
```

        "release_year": 2020,
        "price": 29900,
        "total_page": 250,
        "thickness": "tebal",
        "category_id": 1,
        "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "created_by": "admin",
        "modified_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
